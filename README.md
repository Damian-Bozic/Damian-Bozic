Hi, I'm Damian, a student @42Warsaw.
I'm looking to join the programming industry.
As of November 2025, I'm comfortable with C and C++. However, thanks to 42 Warsaw and the 42 school's methodology, I'm capable of picking up new languages on the fly.
Some specific areas I've particularly enjoyed are algorithms, graphics, optimisation, and multithreading. These are strong characteristics of a graphics programmer.
You can reach me through my email: damian.bozic2@gmail.com
